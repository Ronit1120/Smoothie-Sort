This traces nearby smoothie shops that are modeled by the Cartesian coordinates. Given the locations of the smoothie shops, the shops are then sorted by distance and are to then process queries. After determining if the query point contains a smoothie shop, then determine
the ranking of the smoothie shop in a sorted list in distance from you. The input given by the txt is modeled by the following parameters:
The first line of the input contains 5 integers separated by spaces. The first two of these values are x and y (your location). 
The third integer is n (representing the number of smoothie shops). 
The fourth integer is s (number of points to search for). 
The last integer, t (the threshold to be used for determining whether you run Merge Sort of Insertion Sort). 
The next n lines of the input contain x and y coordinate values(the locations of shops). 

This process uses a combination of merge sort, insertion sort and binary search algorithm.
